# Tekdi's core value rules

## Enjoy the Magic of Creation!
- Prioritize innovative solutions over repetitive implementations
- Leverage existing open source libraries and contribute improvements back
- Focus development time on unique business logic rather than reinventing common patterns
- Embrace learning new technologies and approaches that enhance creativity

## Giving it your Best
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code
- Follow established coding standards and best practices
- Write code that is easy to review and self-documenting
- Document code comprehensively for future maintainers
- Optimize for performance and security from the start

## Build for most, Not for few
- Write configurable, extensible code instead of hardcoded solutions
- Use configuration files, environment variables, and parameterized functions
- Avoid hardcoded values, single-use implementations, and client-specific logic
- Design components for reusability across multiple projects
- Think beyond current requirements to anticipate future needs

## Giving Back
- Contribute reusable components to open source projects
- Extract generic functionality into separate modules/packages
- Structure code contributions to benefit both project and community
- Prepare well-documented improvements for potential upstream contribution
- Write comprehensive inline documentation and code examples

## Product First Mindset (Sustainable Open Source)
- Design modular architecture with clear interfaces
- Separate generic functionality from project-specific logic
- Create components that can be maintained and extended by the community
- Build with long-term sustainability and maintainability in mind
- Consider the broader ecosystem impact of your code decisions
