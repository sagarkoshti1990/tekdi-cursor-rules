# Frontend Performance Optimization Rules

## Bundle and Asset Optimization

### Code Splitting Strategies (Lazy Loading)
- Split code by routes and features to reduce initial bundle size
- Use dynamic imports for components not needed immediately
- Create separate chunks for vendor libraries and dependencies
- Implement lazy loading for conditional features and routes
- Load components on demand based on user interactions

### Tree Shaking and Dead Code Elimination
- Import only specific functions from libraries, avoid default imports
- Use ES modules for better tree shaking support
- Remove unused code and dead branches regularly
- Avoid importing entire utility libraries when only using specific functions

### Asset Optimization
- Compress and optimize images before bundling
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- Implement responsive images with appropriate srcset attributes
- Use CSS sprites or icon fonts for small graphics
- Minimize and compress CSS and JavaScript files

## Runtime Performance Optimization

### Rendering Optimization (Performance First)
- Minimize component re-renders through proper state management
- Use memoization strategically for expensive computations
- Implement proper key props for list rendering
- Avoid creating objects and functions during render
- Use virtualization for large lists and tables

### Memory Management
- Remove object references when components unmount
- Use weak references for large objects when appropriate

### Efficient DOM Operations
- Batch DOM updates to minimize reflows and repaints
- Use DocumentFragment for multiple DOM insertions
- Avoid frequent style changes that trigger layout
- Implement viewport-based rendering for off-screen content

## Network and Loading Optimization

### Resource Loading Strategies
- Preload critical resources in document head
- Use resource hints (prefetch, preconnect, dns-prefetch)
- Implement progressive enhancement patterns
- Optimize critical rendering path
- Use service workers for offline support and caching

### Caching Strategies
- Use service workers for application caching
- Cache API responses with proper invalidation
- Version static assets for cache busting
- Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns

### Request Optimization
- Batch multiple API calls when possible
- Implement request deduplication for concurrent requests
- Use efficient data fetching patterns (GraphQL, efficient REST)
- Compress request and response payloads
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic

## Initial Load Performance

### Critical CSS and Above-the-fold Optimization
- Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Defer non-critical stylesheets
- Remove unused CSS rules and declarations
- Minimize CSS file sizes through optimization
- Use CSS containment for isolated component styles

### JavaScript Loading Optimization
- Defer non-critical scripts until after page load
- Use async attribute for independent scripts
- Minimize parser-blocking scripts
- Load third-party scripts efficiently
- Implement script loading strategies based on user interaction

## User Experience Performance

### Perceived Performance
- Show content skeletons during loading
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Use progressive image loading

### Smooth Interactions
- Keep main thread free for user input
- Respond to user actions within 100ms
- Implement touch feedback immediately
- Debounce expensive operations triggered by user input

## Performance Monitoring (DevOps)

### Performance Budgets
- Write code to track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) during development
- Add performance logging to your debugging code

### Development Performance Practices
- Implement Performance API calls to measure component render times
- Add comments documenting performance optimizations in code

## Performance Testing

### Performance Test Implementation
- Write performance tests that fail when budgets are exceeded
- Write tests that measure component render times
- Add performance assertions to your test suites
